# Assignment 0: Getting started with webpage submission

Goals: Throughout this course, for each assignment, you will be required to submit a webpage of your results. So, the aim of this assignment is to get you familiar with the submission process of the webpage. You will need to create a webpage which consists of text, images, and a GIF. The instructions for uploading your webpage to the class website can be referred [here](https://learning3d.github.io/hw0.html).

## Important Instructions
1. Please note that this assignment only asks you to create a webpage. There is no Canvas submission of code for this assignment only.

2. It is important to get you familiar with uploading text, especially images and GIFs, on the webpage to the class website. Please try to finish all the below tasks.

3. Please do not put any inappropriate content.

4. UPDATE: Since we have a size limit on the AFS user quota, there is a hard limit on the webpage submission to be of only 1MB (for this assignment only). Please adhere to this webpage size.

5. Have fun in this assignment :)


## Task 1. ChatGPT

For this task, play around with [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/). Be creative! Now, mention the prompt and the answer given by ChatGPT in your webpage. You can even mention an interesting conversation.

Some of the prompt examples include: 

1. Write a song/poem/story/joke.

2. Some puzzle or riddle.

## Task 2. 3D shape images

To get you used to uploading images on the webpage, search for a image with an interesting 3D shape. Please mention the source as well.

## Task 3. Funny GIFs

For this task, search around the web for the funniest GIF. Please mention the source as well.

## Webpage Suggestion (Optional)

One easy way to create webpages (that students in previous course iteration reported using) is to write your text using Markdown (.md) and convert it into HTML format.

1. You can use a Jupyter notebook to first create a Markdown (by selecting the Markdown option from the dropdown menu in the above toolbar) and then convert it into HTML using the command 

```
jupyter nbconvert --to html notebook.ipynb
```

2. You can also use online tools like these: https://markdowntohtml.com/.


3. Feel free to use any other mechanism to create webpages though!
